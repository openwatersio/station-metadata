# Provenance

This package publishes **our own factual registry** of tide and current stations.
It is not a copy of any provider's station file. This document records where each
field comes from, so the claim is auditable rather than asserted.

## Operational boundary

The registry is independently authored and reviewed, field by field. Contributors obtain
and verify station facts from charts, gazetteers, fitting output, direct observation, or
other documented sources, then write the registry record here.

> **Never redistribute a provider station export or include a provider-minted identifier.**

Provider data may be consulted at runtime under the consumer's own terms, but a provider's
station file and opaque identifiers do not enter this repository. Agreement with a provider
coordinate does not replace independent authoring and human review.

## Per-field provenance

Each registry record is assembled field by field. It is not one document lifted from one
source.

| Field | Origin |
|-------|--------|
| `name` | **Hand-written label.** Renaming and re-casing shouting provider names (`CHERRY POINT` → `Cherry Point`) is the whole point of this package — original editorial work, reviewed by a person. |
| `context`, `cities`, `aliases` | **Hand-written here.** Not present in provider data; original. |
| `kind` | **Our editorial classification** (`tide` / `current`), assigned by a person against the membership rules the registry writes down — not a field copied from any provider. |
| `tideReference` / `derived.reference` | **Editorial pairing.** Which tide reference port's water to show beside a current gate: the *nearest* `kind: tide` port in the gate's tidal regime, chosen from the positions in this file and, where one exists, confirmed against standard published secondary-reference practice (e.g. Seymour Narrows → Campbell River). A judgment about real water, expressed as an internal registry key on both sides — no provider handle. |
| `position` | **Independently derived and human-verified.** Current-gate positions come from the `chs-constituents` fitting pipeline and `currents-vault` pass frontmatter, cross-checked against `chs-constituents/stations/salish-sea.json`. Tide reference-port positions come from CHS's public prediction-station list, matched by position and confirmed in water by the coastline audit. Both are audited against a coastline and reviewed by a person — a hand-picked set of factual coordinates that happen to agree with CHS, not a lifted copy of a CHS station export. This row is about **authoring** — how a person sourced a coordinate once. How a *consumer* joins at runtime is the next row, and the two are easy to conflate. |
| provider id | **Deliberately absent.** The registry carries no provider-minted identifier at all — not even as a reference. The provider's own opaque handle is resolved at runtime by whoever holds a licence to that provider's API, and it never enters this repository. A consumer joins a record here to that live data by **name or by position** — `signalk-currents` folds the name (with this registry's `aliases` covering a provider rename); `slackwater-web` takes the position within a 3 km tolerance and lets a name mismatch warn but not gate. Both are safe for the same reason, and it is not the choice of key: **filter the provider's list to the series you want first.** CHS publishes a current station *and* a tide gauge named "Porlier Pass", and another pair named "Seymour Narrows", so an unfiltered name is ambiguous; the tide station Duffus Point sits at coordinates identical to the Big Bras D'Or current station, so an unfiltered position is worse. Inside a series-filtered list both keys resolve every gate uniquely. |

The honest summary: the *names, context, and positions* are our work, and there is no
provider handle in the published data at all — the one field that would point *into* a
provider's system is the one field we chose not to ship.

## Third-party place data: `data/places.json`

Everything above is about *station* identity, and none of it changes. `data/places.json` is
not station identity — it is a list of **towns**, used only to derive a fallback caption
("~Nanaimo, BC") for a station that neither the registry nor the corrections file names.

It is a filtered extract of **GeoNames cities500, CC BY 4.0** — a third-party dataset,
redistributed under its licence with attribution in [NOTICE](NOTICE). The bundled coastline
is also third-party data and is attributed there. Neither dataset contains tide or current
station records:

- The rule is *don't redistribute a **provider's** station file* — CHS's or NOAA's list of the
  things we publish records about. GeoNames publishes no tide or current stations, so nothing
  here overlaps a provider's compilation.
- CC BY **grants** redistribution outright. The concern the rule exists to prevent — a
  licence term binding us because we shipped someone's file — is answered by complying with
  it, which costs one attribution line.
- A derived caption is the lowest tier and is always beaten by a curated `context`. Making
  any one station's label better still means writing it in the registry, by hand, as before.

If that trade ever stops being worth it, the exit is cheap: drop the file, and every station
falls back to whatever coarse label the consumer already has.

## Human review

Every station's identity is reviewed by a person before it lands. Positions are audited
against a bundled coastline (`station-metadata audit`) and a moved position shows up in a
lock diff (`station-metadata check`). This review is what converts overlapping facts into
our own verified factual work — see the `source` field on a `RegistryStation` for recording
a per-station provenance that deviates from the defaults above.

## For contributors

When you add or correct a station:

- **Do not paste a row out of a provider's station export.** Obtain the name, context, and
  position independently (chart, gazetteer, the fitting pipeline, direct observation) and
  write them here yourself.
- **Do not add a provider id field.** If your workflow needs the provider's opaque handle to
  join data at runtime, resolve it there, under your own licence to that provider's API — it
  does not belong in this repository.
- If a station's facts came from somewhere other than the defaults in the table above,
  record it in that station's `source` field so the trail stays auditable.
